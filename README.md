Hi, I’m @mitalidighe

Pronouns: She/Her

I’m currently a graduate student at The University of Chicago pursuing an MS in Applied Data Science. 

As a data enthusiast driven by a passion for leveraging analytics to address real-world challenges, I am seeking opportunities where I can merge my expertise in data science with my desire to make a meaningful impact. My interest lies in the intersection of data science, business and technology.

With a strong data analysis and machine learning foundation, I bring over six years of professional experience spanning various domains. 
From spearheading predictive analytics projects to orchestrating data-driven solutions, I have a proven track record of delivering results that drive business growth. 
Here's an overview of my skills and experience:

**Data Analysis and Machine Learning** 

Proficient in data modeling, pattern recognition, statistical analysis and business intelligence, experienced in developing and deploying machine learning models for descriptive, inquisitive, predictive and prescriptive analytics.

**Programming**

Skilled in Python, SQL and R with hands-on experience of 6+ years.

**Data Visualization**

Proficient in using tools like PowerBI, Tableau and Excel to visualize data and communicate insights effectively to technical and non-technical stakeholders.

**Project Management and Leadership**

Experienced in leading cross-functional teams, defining project workflows and managing client interactions with proven ability to streamline processes, mentor team members and drive collaboration to achieve common goals.

**Mentoring**

I enjoy mentoring my teammates and colleagues. I’ve mentored around 1500+ new joiners at my previous company by conducting SQL and team induction sessions.

I am particularly excited about opportunities to collaborate with like-minded individuals to tackle complex challenges and drive innovation. I thrive in dynamic environments where I can apply my analytical skills to solve problems and deliver actionable insights.
